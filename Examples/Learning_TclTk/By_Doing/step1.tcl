# Step 1 - a nice little greet
# =============================================================================
#
# Write a Tcl-Script that sends you a nice little greeting.
#
# DON'T PANIC !!
#
# It's just a one-liner, a `puts` command with the text of the greeting
# following enclosed in double quotes. (On a german keyboard located on the
# shifted '2' key in the top-most row ... NOT a doubled single quote!)
#
# Write this into an ordinary text file, maybe with the suffix `.tcl`, but this
# is a suggestion only, not mandatory.
#
# Run the script in various ways:
# - by starting the Tcl-Interpreter (`tclsh`) interactively and using the
#   `source` command with the name of the script file;
# - by explicitely calling the Tcl-Interpreter followed the name of the
#   of the script file;
# - by pointing to the Tcl-Interpreter with a first "hash-bang"-line in the
#   first line and adding "execute permission" to the script file.

?!? "Nice weather today, not too hot ..."
