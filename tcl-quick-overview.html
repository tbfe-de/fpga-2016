Remark allows to add presenter notes to each page. As that feature is **not**
used by the author of that presentation, it is available for private annotations
from [this page](#content) on.

Assuming you have downloaded and stored this presentation as HTML-file, proceed
as follows:

* Open the file in a text editor of your choice.

* Locate the page which you want to annotate.

  * You may do so by just scrolling down (but often it is easier to)
  * use the text search feature of your editor.

* Locate the separator to the next page (i.e. `---` in a line of its own).

* Before that add another line with three question marks (`???`) only.

Between these to separator lines you can put your annotations and view these
by using as you just view this page.

**Hint:**
Indent code examples with four spaces at the beginning of each line and they
will be displayed with their original line breaks. As an example, below the

## Tcl's General Design

The general design of Tcl combines:

* A mostly trivial syntax

  * supporting some basic data structures

* A standard library providing

  * constructions for flow control

  * some more data structures miscellaneous utilities._[] 

  * introspection and hooks for debugging

* A table-lookup mechanism for dispatching commands

  * **which may be extended by tools** (e.g. Vivado)


---
template: plain
name: tcl_minimal_syntax

## Tcl's Minimal Syntax

Understanding *Tcl's Syntax* actually is:._[]

* Understanding

  * [Command-Separation](#command_separation) and
  * [Word-Separation](#word_separation)

* Understanding various Substitutions:

  * [Variable names for the stored value](#variable_value_substitution)
  * [Subroutines/Commands for what they return](#return_value_substitution)
  * [Escape-Sequences for Non-Printing Characters](#escape_sequences)

* Understanding various forms of *Quoting*

  * [Backslash Quoting](backslash_quoting)
  * [Double_Quote_Quoting](#double_quote_quoting)
  * [Curly Brace Quoting](#curly_brace_quoting)

.F[:
To quote John Ousterhout who designed Tcl in the late 80s:
*Many problems beginners have with Tcl stem from the fact they assume a more
complex syntax as their actually is.*
]

---
template: plain

### Tcl's `eval` command

This is the command you use

* *implicitly* all the time but

* *explicitly* in **very rare** cases only  

It causes the *Tcl Syntax Parser* to

* look at any character string as Tcl command,
* applying word- and command separation,
* plus variable and return value substitution,
* while honoring all quoting,
* ending with looking up the first word as command,
* **– finally executing it –**
* handing over all the remaining words as arguments.

.N[
In other words: it does what happens all the time when Tcl executes a text file
as script of commands.
]

[`eval`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/eval.htm

---
template: plain

### Tcl's `expr` command

This is the command you

* **you need to use explicitly** …

* … in a context that needs to apply

  * basic logic (and, or, not) or

  * arithmetic operations (plus, minus, …) and

  * mathematical functions (square root, sine, cosine, …)

[`expr`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/expr.htm

---
template: plain
name: command_separation

### Command Separation

Tcl separates commands at the following boundaries:

* Newline(s)._[]

* Semicolons

.N[

Note that:

* Command separators are looked for **prior** to any substitution

* So especially newlines "generated" via the escape sequence `\n` are
  **not** command separators

]

.F[:
I.e. ASCII/Unicode Code Point 10 / 0x0A.
]

---
template: plain
name: word_separation

### Word Separation

Tcl separates words **within commands** at the following boundaries:

* Space characters

* Horizontal tabulators._[]

* Sequences of the above

.N[

Note that:

* Word separators are looked for **prior** to any substitution

* So especially tabulators "generated" via the escape sequence `\t` are
  **not** word separators

]

.F[:
I.e. ASCII/Unicode Code Point 9 / 0x09.
]

---
template: plain
name: variable_value_substitution

### Substituting Variable Content

Tcl substitutes a variable name for the content of that variable

* When the name._[] of a variable is preceded by `$`

  * and the variable exists (i.e. has a value assigned to it)

  * **otherwise it is an error**


.F[:
The spelling of variable names in Tcl are a (slight) super-set of what is valid
in most other programming languages. By enclosing the variable name **after**
the `$`-sign into curly braces the rules can even be more "relaxed", so that
nearly **anything** will be acceptable as variable name – though readability
will be hurt if this freedom is exploited too frequently.
]

---
template: plain
name: return_value_substitution

### Substituting Subroutine Return Values

Tcl substitutes the return value of a subroutine

* If the complete command, i.e.

  * command name and all arguments following

  * are enclosed in square brackets

* For the part inside square brackets

  * a recursive syntax analysis is started

  * which may in turn use square brackets 

  * leading to nested command substitutions._[]

.N.center[
Note that this applies as well to **all built-in commands** of Tcl as to
(additional) sub-routines defined via the `proc` commands.
]

.F[:
Though technically many levels are possible, for readability any nesting should
be kept rather flat by storing return values required as arguments (to other
commands in temporary variables with a "telling name".
]

[`proc`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/proc.htm

---
template: plain
name: escape_sequences

### Escape Sequences for Non-Printing Characters

This is a Tcl feature taken from the C programming language:

* `\a` → Audible Bell Character (ASCII/Unicode Code Point 7 / 0x07)
* `\b` → Backspace (ASCII/Unicode Code Point 8 / 0x08)
* `\t` → Horizontal Tab (ASCII/Unicode Code Point 9 / 0x09)
* `\n` → Newline Tab (ASCII/Unicode Code Point 10 / 0x0a)
* `\v` → Vertical Tab (ASCII/Unicode Code Point 11 / 0x0B)
* `\r` → Carriage Return (ASCII/Unicode Code Point 12 / 0x0C)

.N.center[
Octal and hexadecimal notations are supported too, like in C89.
]

---
template: plain
name: backslash_quoting

### Backslash Quoting

A backslash may preceded any character.

* If this is **not** an escape sequence for a non-printing character …

* … the character directly following is taken verbatim. e.g.

  * the word separators are taken as a verbatim space or horizontal tabulator
    (character)

  * the variable substitution request `$` is a verbatim dollar using `\$`

  * the command substitution request `[` and `]` are verbatim square brackets
    using `\[` and `\]`

  * the command separator `;` is a verbatim semicolon using `\;`

  * **to obtain a single backslash it needs to be written as `\\`**

.N[
Note that a backslash at the end of a line is a special case:  
Together the newline character following **and** all white space at the start
of the next line it is **replaced with a single space character**.
]

---
template: plain
name: double_quote_quoting

### Double Quote Quoting

Any sequence of characters my be enclosed in double quotes and inside

* command and word separation will **not take place**

* but anything else **will** work as if it were unquoted:

    * `$` requests
      [*Variable → Value* substitution](#variable_value_substitution)
    * `[` … `]` requests
      [*Command → Return Value* substitution](#return_value_substitution)
    * `\` will
      * **either**
        [quote one of the above](#backslash_quoting)
      * **or** work as escape sequence for
        [non-printing characters](#escape_sequences)

.N[
Note that with respect to quoting with double quotes a backslash used

* **outside** turns an (initial) `\"` into a verbatim double quote;

* **inside** turns `\"` into representing a (contained) double quote.
]

---
template: plain
name: curly_brace_quoting

### Curly Brace Quoting

Any sequence of characters may be enclosed in a pair of curly braces and inside

* any characters contained are taken verbatim

* up to the (matching) closing curly brace

.N[
Note that

* the **matching** curly brace is determined by
  * counting opening and closing braces
  * but **not** removing them;
* a **contained** curly brace is
  * exempt from being counted
  * but the backslash is **not** removed.

## Tcl for General Scripting

As general scripting language Tcl has its Pro's and Con's:._[]

* Advantages are:

  * Open Source (continuation does not depend on a third party)
  * Mature, stable and always striving for backward compatibility
  * Established community of dedicated users
  * Proven use in many serious projects (since ~25 years)
  * Efficient and small memory footprint
  * Extensible to GUI-Programming with Tk
  * **Known from FPGA Scripting Tools**

* Disadvantages are:

  * Not much hype anymore (nowadays)
  * Might be considered "out-dated" and therefore …
  * … not be attractive to many software developers
  * Relatively small user community
  * Nifty "modern" GUI-Controls missing

.F[:
Compared to "more modern" alternatives.
]

---
template: plain
name: event_driven_design

## Tcl and Event Driven Design

Tcl lends itself well to event driven software designs.

* An event-driven architecture

  * consists of may small handlers
  * to which a central dispatches events
  * is preferable anyway for GU-programming

* It usally depends on the posibility for an application …

  * …  to send events to itself
  * … either with or without delay

* The design challenge is to keep handlers small

---
template: plain

### Pro's and Con's of the Event-Driven Approach

Advantages include:

* Handlers run single-threaded to their end

  * No need for mutexes or any other thread synchronisation

  * Therefore no worries
    * accidental data inconsistencies,
    * about race conditions,
    * or deadlocks

Disadvantages include:

* Forcibly breaking long handlers may not feel "natural"

* Will not easily scale to multi-core hardware

---
template: plain

### Tcl Commands for Event-Driven Architectures

The following commands are essential for event-driven Tcl programming:

* [`after`] – execute some handler deferred or continue via event-loop

* [`fileevent`] – execute some handler when there is

  * data available **when reading** from a file or socket

  * space available._[] **when writing** to a file or socket

* [`socket`] `-server` – provide a "half-open" TCP/IP connection to accecpt
  connection requests from clients in a server application

.N[
There is also a command [`update`] to enter the event-loop recursively but
using it **is not recommended because handlers have to consider to be called
re-entrant.**
]

.F[:
Though most Tcl programs do not care about it, filling-up  output buffers
*might* lead to an application being blocked in an event handler an become
unresponsive.

### Code-Walking a Real Project

[
.N.center[
The speaker will take you on a code-walk through a real project.
]
](Examples/MultiMeter/dt9062.tcl)

The code was written some years ago to interface with measurement data sent
from a digital multimeter through a serial interface.

You may feel that "some years" is a bit of understatement:

Actually this multimeter was bought by the author about 15 years ago and the
code shown was written around that time. The interesting fact is it still works
essentially unchangend on any system with a Tcl interpreter that also offers
the Tk extension for GUI programming.._[]

* Whenever it was "ported" to a different host the only change was to  
  **adapt the device name of the serial port**.

* Whenever it had to be "ported" to more recent version of Tcl/Tk  
  **no changes at all had to be made**.

.F[:
Though it hardly might make sense in practice, the code would – at least in
principle – also work with *Embedded Tcl Interpreters* like the ones integrated
in design tools for scripting. The only catch is that the event-loop of Tcl/Tk
might not smoothly interface with an event-driven GUI.  Vivado GUI-mode e.g.
uses its own event-loop which has no provisions to merge-in other event-loops.

### Tcl and Vivado – The Big Picture

* Being **A *Tool Command Language* by Design** …

* … Tcl lends itself perfectly as scripting language for Vivado …

* … though the added commands not always follow conventions and
  style of (native) Tcl

---
template: linkinfo
graphic: VivadoModesAndTcl
name: nonproject_vs_project_mode

#### Non-Project vs. Project Mode

* *Non-Project Mode* and *Project Mode* are two ways to use Vivado
  during design elaboration …

* … but the difference is **not** how much of the work is done via
  GUI and how much with Tcl

---
template: linkinfo
graphic: VivadoProjectMode
name: understanding_project_mode

#### Understanding Project Mode

* Relationships in *Project Mode* need some more explanation

* Basically it automates managing dependencies between files while minimising
  tool use

* Also options for various optimisation runs are specified in a packaged
  form, called *Strategies*

---
template: plain
name: vivado_command_conventions

### Vivado Command Conventions

As already has been mentioned Tcl commands

* evaluate their arguments themselves (each)

* hence achieve "uniformity" by following conventions only

* where *Tcl Style* and *Vivado Style* slightly differs

.N.center[
Differences are not quite from separate worlds but visible enough.
]

Therefore it pays to be aware of a command's origin – Tcl or Vivado …._[]

.F[:
… somewhat like being aware whether driving a gear-shifting car or a
car with automatic transmission – Tcl is more on the gear-shifting side,
Vivado more on the other (author's advice and personal opinion).  
The reasons for the differences are manifold and partially speculative:
(1) Tcl itself is not completely "as if made from one piece" and therefore
not quite consistent. (2) There may have been the intent to be more
"user friendly" in Vivado. (3) Scarce resources originally guiding some
Tcl design decisions are no longer an issue today.

### Understanding the Design Model

Prior to navigating._[] within the design using Tcl commands there needs to be a basic
understanding the model itself.

---
template: plain
name: basics_of_design_navigation

#### Basics of Design Navigation

Navigating to objects in the design model is similar to navigating to files
in a directory tree.

* There is a *Top Level Object* …

    * (much like the root directory of a file system)

* … which may also be changed

    * (much like the current working directory)

#### Understanding Object Relations

Objects are inter-related via connections._[]

template: plain

#### Navigating via Relations

The general form is this:._[]

* `get_`*`kind`* ` -of_objects ` *`which`*, where

   * *`kind`* depends on the type of objects **to be** looked-up, and

   * *`which`* is the type of objects **from which** the relation originates

.N.center[
**Not all combinations of *`kind`* and *`which`* are valid!**

Get accustomed to look-up proper usage in [XILINX UG835] or use the command with
the `-help` option interactively.

Note that the syntax chosen seems to strive for being readable in natural language:  
`get_pins -of_objects [get_nets -hier]`

#### Filtering on Selection

Many commands selecting objects have a `-filter` option

* The required syntax deviates somewhat from Tcl style

* Often it makes sense to put the whole selection in curly braces

.N.center[
**Be aware no variable substitution takes place in curly braces.**._[]
]

.F[:
Be aware of backslash substitutions (for `\n`, `\t`, etc.) if you use double
quotes instead and be aware of word (and command) separation if you use no
quoting at all.

#### Accessing Object Properties

Design objects generally have properties._[]

* Some properties are common to all objects

* Others vary with the type of object

* (also filtering is based on properties)

### From Design Model to Bitstream

* The typical final goal of any design is the *Bitstream File*

* Before this can happen the design usually needs some elaboration

* (Thorough testing not shown here – though highly to recommend
  before generating and using a bitstream file)


.F[:
Of course there are many reasons why a bitstream file might be never produced.
E.g. a design could turn out to be inappropriate during elaboration or
testing and is completely overturned. Or the goal is to just to test tools
Vivado uses internally. Finally, the bitstream files eventually produced
during this workshop are also not of much interest … (and will probably
never be loaded to a concrete hardware).

#### Non-Project Mode Outline

In *Non-Project Mode*

* Files (Verilog/VHDL, Constraints, Simulation) need to explicitly loaded

* Toos (Synthesis, Implementation/Optimizations) need to explicitly run
