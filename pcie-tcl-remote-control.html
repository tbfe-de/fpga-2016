Remark allows to add presenter notes to each page. As that feature is **not**
used by the author of that presentation, it is available for private annotations
from [this page](#content) on.

Assuming you have downloaded and stored this presentation as HTML-file, proceed
as follows:

* Open the file in a text editor of your choice.

* Locate the page which you want to annotate.

  * You may do so by just scrolling down (but often it is easier to)
  * use the text search feature of your editor.

* Locate the separator to the next page (i.e. `---` in a line of its own).

* Before that add another line with three question marks (`???`) only.

Between these to separator lines you can put your annotations and view these
by using as you just view this page.

**Hint:**
Indent code examples with four spaces at the beginning of each line and they
will be displayed with their original line breaks. As an example, below the
page structure including annotations is shown:

    name: used_for_internal_links
    header: ## Shown at the Top of the Page

    Simply scroll down through this document loaded in an editor and you will
    probably catch the basics of Markdown-Syntax easily, e.g.  how to put in
    *slight* or **strong** emphasis or [add a link](http://tbfe.de/downloads).

name: what_to_expect

## What You Can Expect

Please understand that

* 90 Minutes are a long time …

  * … if you have to stand on one leg

* but are far from being sufficient to

  * learn the basics of Tcl/Tk

  * walk though a lot of example code

  * allow some time to practice yourself

  * fully understand the *PCIe Remote Control Application*

.N.center[
Nevertheless: Let's Try our Best!
]

---
template: plain

### Our Goal …

… for the next hour plus some time is this:

* Whet your appetite by

  * demonstrating the PCIe Remote Control and

  * the (relatively) tiny amount of code it requires

* Teach the *Absolute Crash Course on Tcl/Tk* …

  * … with showing a examples for Tcl/Tk programming

* Allow some time (20…30 Minutes) for practical work

* Close with reviewing the solutions as more coding examples

---
template: plain
name: pcie_controller_demo

## The *PCIe Controller* Demo

The following will be demonstrated:

* For the LEDs (as represented in the `/sys/tcl_drv/`-directory):

  * A Tcl program showing the basic approach to write to the device files
    representing the LEDs (48 LOC).

  * A Tcl program displaying a pattern repeatedly (77 LOC).

  * A Tk-based GUI-program for switching the LEDs (64 LOC).

* For the Switches (as represented in the `/sys/tcl_drv/`-directory):._[]

  * A Tcl program showing the basic approach (56 LOC).

  * A Tk-based GUI program with adding some more functionality (140 LOC).

.F[:
The switches are generally polled in the demo programs. While polling in
general is not a nice solution, it had to be used here because the PCIe driver
implemented in earlier sessions does not support an interrupt driven access.
]

---
template: plain
name: pcie_remote_controller_demo

## The *PCIe **Remote** Controller* Demo

The following will be demonstrated:

* For the LEDs a TCP/IP-based Client/Server Remote Controller

  * Server 137 LOC

  * Client 99 LOC

* For the Switches a TCP/IP-base Client/Server Remote Controller

  * Server (not yet finished)

  * Client (not yet finished)

---
template: plain
name: command_syntax

### Command Syntax			

A Tcl Script is a series of *Commands*, each of which consists of *Words*.

* Commands (of a script) are separated by

  * line endings or

  * semicolons

* Words (of a command) are separated by

  * any amount of white space, which is

    * space (ASCII/Unicode code point 32) or

    * horizontal tab character (ASCII/Unicode code point 9)

.N.center[
Separators are only recognized at a very early step of syntax analysis,  
**not** if they are inserted by one of the substitution mechanisms.
]

---
template: plain
name: variable_substitution

### Variable Substitution

Variable values are

* set (and defined) with the Tcl command `set` and

* their value gets substituted into a command line …

  * … when a dollar (`$`) sign is followed by the name of an existing variable

```
set name "Dipl.-Ing Martin Weitzel"
puts "== $name =="
```

.N.center[
Using a variable name that hasn't been set before._[] will lead to an error
during script execution.
]

.F[:
The same is – of course – true if the variable had been set once but was
removed with the Tcl-Command `unset`.
]

---
template: plain
name: return_value_substitution

### Return Value Substitution

Tcl has commands that are built-in, furthermore subroutines may be defined with
the `proc` command._[]

* Their return values get substituted into a command line …

  * … when the call of a is surrounded by square brackets (`[` … `]`).

```
proc line {n {c *}} {
	return [string repeat $c $n]
}

puts [line 20]
puts [line 40 =]
```

.N.center[
All Tcl commands and subroutines will "return" something – though it may be
just an empty string._[]
]

.F[:
If there is no explicit `return` in a sub-routine defined with the `proc`
command the return value of the command executed last executed in the
sub-routine will be ts return value.
]

---
template: plain
name: various_forms_of_quoting

### Various Forms of Quoting		

There are several mechanisms to remove to step into Tcl's syntax analysis:


* **Full Quoting**  
  Enclose parts of a command line into curly braces (`{` … `}`)

  * Everything is taken verbatim
  * Curly braces are "counted" only to find the matching close brace

* **Partial Quoting**  
  Enclose parts of a command line into curly braces (`"` … `"`)

  * **No** command or word separation takes place
  * **but** variable and return value substitution still works

* **Single Character Quoting**  
  Prepend a back-slash (`\`) to any character that shall be taken verbatim

.N.center[
Back-slashes also allow to express certain "non-printing" characters,  
exactly as they do in C/C++.
]

---
template: plain
name: doing_arithmetic

### Doing Arithmetic

Arithmetic **is not part of the Syntax** what makes Tcl different from most any
other widely used programming language.

* General arithmetic operations are done with the `expr` command.  

  * It handles all of the arithmetic expression operators known from C

  * The well-known mathematical functions are supported too

* The frequent case of an integer increment is handled with `incr`

  * It has the step as optional argument …

  * … so it can be used for decrement too
]

.pull-left[
```
puts [expr 6*7]
puts [expr 1u<<12]
puts [expr 1/sqrt(2)]
puts [expr 2*acos(0.0)]
```
]

.pull-right[
```
set i 10; puts "i=$i"
incr i;   puts "i=$i"
puts "up by 1: [incr i]"
puts "down by 7: [incr i -7]"
```
]

---
template: plain
name: handling_variables

### Handling Variables

The Tcl command `set` may be used to

* **assign** a value to a variable (if followed be two words), or 

* **retrieve** the value from a variable (if followed by one word only)

.N.center[
Variable substitution with `$` exists for convenience only!
]

```
set name "Dipl.-Ing Martin Weitzel"
puts "== [set name] =="
```

---
template: plain
name: arrays_and_lists

### Array and Lists			

Part of a variable **name**

* may be an *Index* enclosed in round parentheses (`(` … `)`)

* which *does not* need to be numeric but can be any string

.N.center[
Tcl arrays are rather lookup-tables for "key - value" pairs.
]

Furthermore, a variable

* may contain a number of space separated items and

* can then be accessed as *List*.._[]

.N.center[
Tcl lists are rather like native arrays in C/C++: Their elements are indexed
seqentially from `0` to one less than the list length.
]

.F[:
Frequently used commands for working with lists are `list`, `llength`,
`lindex`, `lreplace`, `lset`, `lassign` …
]

---
template: plain
name: tcl_flow_control

### Flow Control				

Tcl implements all of its flow control with commands too:

* Conditional branching with `if` and `switch`

* Repetition with `while` and `foreach`

* Traversing a list with `foreach`

.pull-left[
Print command line arguments, or a
message that none exist exist:
```
if {$argc == 0} {
	puts "(no args)"
} else {
	foreach arg $argv {
		puts "* $arg"
}
```
]

.pull-right[
Enumerate command line arguments, starting from 1:
```
set i 0
while {$i < $argc}
	set arg [lindex $argv $i]
	puts "[incr i]. $arg"
}
```
]

---
template: plain
name: tcl_subroutines

### Subroutines	

Subroutines are

* **defined** with the `proc` command

* **called** like any ordinary (built-in) command

.N.center[
Subroutines also support various forms of argument handling,  
including default values and variable length argument lists.
]

Most usages of sub-routines will be shown in concrete code examples.

The following does for floating point what `incr` does for inegral values:._[]

.pull-left[
```
proc fincr {vname {step 1.0}} {
	upvar $vname v
	set v [expr $v + $step}]
}
```
]
.pull-right[
```
set PI 3.14152; puts $PI
fincr PI;       puts $PI
fincr PI -0.5;  puts $PI
```
]

.F[:
Note that `incr` returns the new (incremented) value. So, is there a `return`
command missing from the implementation of `fincr`?
]

---
template: plain
name: error_recovery

### Error-Recovery

Recovering from errors triggered by a failing operation can be done in the
following (cookbook) style:._[]

```
...
if {[catch { operation-that-may-fail } result]} {
    # if the operarion actually failed this point is reached
    # (with details of the nature of the problem in `result`)
    ... ;# handle error
} else {
    # if the operation run to completion this point is reached
    # (with the return value of the operation in `result`)
    ... ;# proceed with normal processing
   
}
...
```

.F[:
The above assumes the typical case, where a Tcl command indicates a problem by
aborting further processing. If some subroutine implemented in Tcl needs to
indicate a problem in that way, the command `error` can be used.
]

---
template: plain
name: string_handling

### String handling			

Tcl's `string` command has many sub-commands useful for operations on character
strings:

* `string length …` – determine number of contained characters
* `string index …` – and return single character at given index
* `string range …` – and return part of a string between given indices
* `string equal …` – compare strings to have the same value
* `string compare …` – compare strings much line `strcmp` from C
* `string first …` – locate sub-string startng from left end
* `string last …` – locate sub-string startng from right end
* `string repeat …` – create a string by repeating a pattern
* `string is …` – test for certain qualities of a string's content

```
proc check_args_or_die {} {
    if {[llength $::argv] == 0} {
        puts stderr "Usage: $::argv0 <host:port>"; exit 1
    }
    lassign [split [lindex $::argv 0] :] host port
    if {![string is integer $port] || $port < 1 || $port > 65535} {
        puts stderr "$::argv0: invalid ip-port: $port"; exit 2
    }
}
```

---
template: plain
name: input_and_output

### Input and Output			

Input and output is closely modelled after the C-style opaque `FILE` type:

* `open` returns a *Channel* which is handed over to one or more of
  * `puts` – write whole line, or partial with the `nonewline` option
  * `gets`, `read` – read whole line or given amount of characters._[]
  * `eof` – test for end-of-file condition
  * `tell`, `seek` – set position for next input or output operation
  * `fconfigure` – modify certain details, like
    * buffering (non, by line, by block)
    * various translation modes, or
    * settings of a serial device (baud-rate etc.)
* finally the channel needs to be `close`-d to return system resources

.pull-left[
```
set fd [open myfile.txt r]
while {[gets $fd line] >= 0} {
    # ...
}
close $fd
```
]
.pull-right[
```
set fd [open trace.log]
fconfigure $fd -buffering none
puts $fd -nonewline started\ ...
# ...
puts $fd " done"
```
]

.F[:
Not specifying the amount of characters means to read as much as possible.
]

---
template: plain
name: file_system_ops

### File System Operations

The following commands deal with files in the whole:

* `file` – access or set various properties and more, via sub-commands

  * `exists`, `readable`, `writable`, … – test if existing etc
  * `size`, `mtime`, `atime`, … – size and time-stamps
  * `isdirectory`, `isfile`, `isexecutable`, … – test that property
  * `dirname`, `rootname`, `nativename`, `extension` … – parts of name
  * `mkdir`, `copy`, `rename` … – (as the names suggests)
  * `separator` – typically `/` (Unix/Linux) or `\` (Windows/MS-DOS)

* `glob` – list (matching) file names in a directory._[]

```
foreach sw [glob -directory /sys/tcl_drv/sw*] {
	if {[catch {open $led r} fd]} continue
	puts "$sw -> [read $fd 1]"
	close $fd
}
```

.F[:
Note that `glob` produces the list of files in no particular order, but sorting
by alphabetically by name is easy:
`… [lsort [glob -directory /sys/tcl_drv/sw*]] …`
]

---
template: plain
name: event_driven_design

### Event-Driven Design

The following Tcl commands support event-driven designs:

* `fileevent` *`chan`* `readable` …  
  `fileevent` *`chan`* `writable` …  
  register call-back if a channel becomes readable or writable

* `after` *`msec`* …  
  register call-back (to be executed via event-loop) after a delay of
  *`msec`* milliseconds

* `socket -server` … *`port`*  
  register callback for incoming connection requests on given `*port*`

* `vwait` *`varname`*  
  enter event-loop until variable named by *`varname`* gets modified

.N.center[
If Tcl used with a Tk GUI **only** the event-driven designs make sense!
]

.F[:
The delay may also be `0` for immediate execution, **after all currently
queued** events.
]

---
template: plain
name: widgets_in_general

### Widgets in General

A small but fully working example is this …
```
#!/usr/bin/wish

set font {Sans 50}

label .counter -font $font -width 5

button .up -text + -width 2 -font $font
button .down -text – -width 2 -font $font
button .exit -text EXIT -command exit

grid .up .counter -sticky nwse
grid .down  ^     -sticky nwse
grid .exit  -     -sticky nwse
```
… more will follow in the code-walks.

---
template: plain
name: graphical_arrangement

### Graphical Widget Arrangement (1)

In general the layout of widgets is

* **not** specified by (pixel) positions, but

* by **strategies** for their arrangement.

Here is a different approach using the `grid`der instead of the `pack`er:
```
... # as before

pack .up -side left -fill y
pack .down -side right -fill y
pack .exit -side bottom -fill x
pack .counter -fill both -expand 1

...

```

---
template: plain

### Graphical Widget Arrangement (2)

Getting comfortable with the use of `pack` and `grid` pays in so far

* as nearly any layout of widgets may be achieved

* including user-friendly resizing behaviour

Here is an example with a nested use of `pack`-ed and a `grid`-ded layout:
```
set font {Sans 50}

label .counter -font $font -width 5
frame .buttons -relief ridge -borderwidth 3
button .buttons.up -text + -width 2 -font $font
button .buttons.down -text – -width 2 -font $font
button .exit -text EXIT -command exit

grid .buttons.up .buttons.down -sticky nesw
pack .buttons -side top -fill x
pack .counter -fill both -expand 1
pack .exit -side bottom -fill x
```


---
template: plain
name: connect_to_variables

### How to connect to Variables …

In the previous code only widgets were create and made visible.

For a working application some data (the counter value) needs to be added:
```
...
set cvalue 0
label .counter -font $font -width 5 -textvariable cvalue
...
```

Such a connection is not only "one way" but bidirectional, as can be easily
shown by start `wish` interactively with a `scale` created like below and …
```
pack [scale .s -from 1 -to 200 -length 500 -variable x]
```
… while moving the slider issue commands to inspect and modify `x`:

.pull-left[
```
puts $x
```
]
.pull-right[
```
set x 52
```
]

---
template: plain
name: connect_to_commands

### … and Commands

To complete the Up/Down-Counter example, the buttons are finally connected
to the commands modifying the variable `cvalue` accordingly:
```
...
button .buttons.up -text + -width 2 -font $font\
	-command {incr cvalue}
button .buttons.down -text – -width 2 -font $font\
	-command {incr cvalue -1}
...
```

## Some Code Walk or time to DIY

At this point the road splits:

* Either you can work on some practical examples yourself …

* … or we continue with a guided code-walk through some

.N.center[

### The PCIe Remote Controller

There is a collection of examples in directory
[Tcl-Tk-PCIe/tcl_app](Examples/Tcl-Tk-PCIe/tcl_app)
that are best viewed and explained in the following order:

* [leds-set-simple.tcl		](Examples/Tcl-Tk-PCIe/tcl_app/leds-set-simple.tcl)

### Some Practical Exercises for DIY

There is a set of exercises, from simple to advanced, in 9 steps..[]

* There are source files with small omissions, marked with `?!?`

  * These files are in directory:
    [Examples/Learning_TclTk/By_Doing](Examples/Learning_TclTk/By_Doing)

.N[
Here you would have to fill in the missing parts so that the code works
as described in the comments at the start of the files.

* You may view the solutions (with the missing parts filled):

  * These files are in directory:
    [Examples/Learning_TclTk/Solved](Examples/Learning_TclTk/Solved)

.F[:
Some advanced examples are a *Server* and a *Client*. The latter has the suffix
`x` after its numbered step.

template: plain
name: thats_all

## OK - That's All

My suggestion is we now walk through some of the basic PCIe examples, where the
device driver is accessed via device files using Tcl.

You then may decide whether

* **we** continue with advanced examples, going into more depth,

* or **you** continue with the *"Do It Yourself Exercises"*.

(We can also mix the above, working in separate groups.)
