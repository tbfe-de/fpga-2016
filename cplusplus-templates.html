As it has been created using the free HTML4-Tool [Remark](http://remarkjs.com),
its content is written using the
[Markdown-Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
so you may even enhance the purely electronic (non-printed) form with your own
annotations, only by means of any ordinary text editor. Just hit the P-key while
viewing this in an internet browser, and follow instructions.

(use +/- above to adjust the font size for convenient reading)

Remark allows to add presenter notes to each page. As that feature is **not**
used by the author of that presentation, it is available for private annotations
from [this page](#content) on.

Assuming you have downloaded and stored this presentation as HTML-file, proceed
as follows:

* Open the file in a text editor of your choice.

* Locate the page which you want to annotate.

  * You may do so by just scrolling down (but often it is easier to)
  * use the text search feature of your editor.

* Locate the separator to the next page (i.e. `---` in a line of its own).

* Before that add another line with three question marks (`???`) only.

Between these to separator lines you can put your annotations and view these
by using as you just view this page.

**Hint:**
Indent code examples with four spaces at the beginning of each line and they
will be displayed with their original line breaks. As an example, below the
page structure including annotations is shown:

    template: plain
    name: used_for_internal_links
    header: ## Shown at the Top of the Page

    Simply scroll down through this document loaded in an editor and you will
    probably catch the basics of Markdown-Syntax easily, e.g.  how to put in
    *slight* or **strong** emphasis or [add a link](http://tbfe.de/downloads).

    ???
    From here follow the [Presenter Notes], i.e. your private annotations
    ...
    ...

    [Presenter Notes]: adding-longer-links-that-keeps-text--uncluttered

    ...
    up to here.

To return to the normal view, now press the P-key once more.

<!--
If you want to put in meta-annotations, i.e. text that is not even shown
after pressing the P-key, simply use HTML comments, like it is done here.
